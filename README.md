# LPOO_71 Crack Attack

> The project goal is to recreate the game [Crack attack](http://www.aluminumangel.org/attack/). The game's goal is to not let the blocks get to the top (like tetris) by making lines with at least 3 colored blocks with the same colour to pop them thus increasing the score. In a nutshell this a game is a mix between tetris and candy crush like games.
