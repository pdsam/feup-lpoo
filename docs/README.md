# LPOO_71 Crack Attack

> The project goal is to recreate the game "Crack attack" (http://www.aluminumangel.org/attack/). The game's goal is to not let the blocks get to the top(like tetris) by making lines with at least 3 colored blocks with the same colour to pop them thus increasing the score.

<!--
> Include here one or two paragraphs explaining the main idea of the project, followed by a sentence identifying who the authors are. 
-->
## Implemented Features
<!--
> This section should contain a list of implemented features and their descriptions. In the end of the section, include two or three screenshots that illustrate the most important features.
-->
## Planned Features
<!--
> This section is similar to the previous one but should list the features that are not yet implemented. Instead of screenshots you should include GUI mock-ups for the planned features.

## Design
<!--
> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts: "Problem in Context", "The Pattern", "Implementation" and "Consequences".
-->
## Known Code Smells and Refactoring Suggestions
<!--
> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation, and suggest ways in which the code could be refactored to eliminate them. Each smell and refactoring suggestions should be described in its own subsection.
-->
A few code smells we can already point out are:

	1. The class Board is too large, because at this point it handles the drawing on the screen which it should not do. So, we will need to extract a class from Board to split the Model from the view.
	2. 
	3. 
## Testing Results
<!--
> This section should contain screenshots of the main results of both the test coverage and mutation testing reports. It should also contain links to those reports in HTML format (you can copy the reports to the docs folder).
-->
## Self-evaluation
<!--
> In this section describe how the work regarding the project was divided between the students. In the event that members of the group do not agree on a work distribution, the group should send an email to the teacher explaining the disagreement.
